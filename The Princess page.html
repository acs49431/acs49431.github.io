		<h4>Known for her cunning, dexterity, dashing good looks, expert abilities, and ultimate badassery, Princess Kaya has often been compared to the 
		author Ashton Sanders herself. While some may be streching, others believe that the character and her dragon are actually the author splitting her
		personality into two separate character figures. For those of you wondering, that exactly what it is because I am awesome thank you for your 
		time. </h4>
