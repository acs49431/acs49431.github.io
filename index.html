		<div style="text-align:left">
		<H4>There once was brave Prince named Alex. He lived in a castle in the land of 
		Solaria and his father, King Bryer, was known throughout the land as the wisest,
		most benevolent king the land of Solaria had ever known. Alex lived together 
		with his two older brothers, Marcus and Aurelius, his mother, Queen Lilian, and 
		the wise King himself. He grew up happy, healthy, and strong and while his 
		brothers practiced swinging swords and running kingdoms, Alex spent his time 
		reading books and studying the art of persuasion. What he lacked in speed and 
		strength, he made up for in cunning and manipulation. But even with these gifts 
		and talents, honed after years tricking his brothers, Alex never used his 
		persuasive abilities for the purpose of evil. He was pure and good and whole and
		he lived his life without a care in the world.</h4>
	
		<h4>News of the generous King spread quickly across the lands and fell upon the 
		ears of a wind drake, a dragon as fierce and voracious as the howling winds of 
		the North Sea. The dragon, Markys, had heard of the prosperous kingdom and vowed
		to attack in order to expand the treasure in his hovel. With a mighty roar great
		enough to shake the roots of the nearest shrubbery, Markys leapt off the edge of
		his mountain abode and flexed his membraned wings, allowing the breadth of their
		span to launch him high into the inky black sky. His iridescent scales glimmered
		in the light of the moon and to those who looked above, he would only appear as 
		a shimmer of light amongst the stars as he sped away to the land of Solaria.</h4>
	
		<h4> 	But the dragon Markys, fueled by his greed and desire, failed to reach 
		the land of Solaria before swooping down on a castle and grabbing the nearest 
		princess. Intending to hold her for ransom, the dragon carried her away, far 
		into the hills where only an adventurer could find her. </h4>
