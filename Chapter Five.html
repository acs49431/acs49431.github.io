	<h4>The shimmering scales of the great dragon flickered and faded into the blackness 
	of the starry night. Looking up, Alex could almost see the golden haired rider swaying
	up and down on crook of the dragon&rsquo;s back, though it wasn&rsquo;t long before the white 
	scales and long blonde hair had vanished from view completely. Prince Alex turned to 
	Sir David. </h4>
	
	<h4><q>Do you think she will be happy as a rider?</q></h4>
	
	<h4><q>Absolutely. She has the fire seen only in the greatest of knights,</q> Sir David 
	replied. <q>But you, your highness. What will you do? She was your chance for a crown.</q> </h4>
	
	<h4>Alex smiled. </h4>
	
	<h4><q>That&rsquo;s alright. I don&rsquo;t think it would have worked between us anyway. I believe I 
	have already found a better match,</q> Alex nudged Sir David&rsquo;s shoulder and ran cackling 
	into his castle home, leaving Sir David with red cheeks and a befuddled expression on 
	his face. </h4>
