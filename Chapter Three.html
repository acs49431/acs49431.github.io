	<h4>A spike of fear shot through Alex and he grabbed the arm of Sir David.</h4>
	<h4><q>Look outside,</q> he hissed, pointing to the nearby white mound slowly rising and 
	falling. A dawning realization crossed Sir David&rsquo;s weary face, followed shortly by a 
	grim expression. </h4>
	<h4><q>We should attack now, before it stirs.</q></h4>
	<h4>Prince Alex paled, but gave him an assenting nod. Gathering their weapons and 
	shaking off their sleepiness, the two crept quietly from the crevice and made their 
	way toward the moving mound. Sure enough, as they got closer, they began to make out 
	the dragon&rsquo;s horns and its claws. Its iridescent scales reflected the brilliant light 
	of the full moon, and with every exhale, a great warm breeze passed over the hiding 
	spot of the Knight and the Prince. Alex felt a shiver of fear, but was reassured by 
	Sir David&rsquo;s determined expression. After all, they had to save the princess. </h4>
	<h4>Trying not to image a frail girl cowering in fear at the mercy of the mighty dragon,
	Alex focused on the task at hand. He and Sir David devised a plan to sneak up and 
	slay the dragon before it could awake and began creeping towards its sleeping body. 
	Taking careful step after careful step, Prince Alex inched nearer and nearer to the
	underside of the dragon&rsquo;s neck, stalking silently through the patches of dirt 
	surrounding the breathing mound. As he got closer, he began to identify the best 
	place to slash. Soundlessly raising his sword, he chose his spot and slashed with 
	all his might.</h4>
	<h4>A violent clang echoed around the hillside and the enormous mound stirred. A 
	giant orange eye opened inches away from Alex and dragon&rsquo;s massive head rose high 
	into the sky. But Alex&rsquo;s attention was focused on a Knight. A Knight dressed in 
	shimmering white scaled armor and blocking his sword with one of gleaming silver. 
	The mysterious knight shoved Prince Alex and he stumbled back. Sir David appeared 
	by his side, sword drawn and fire in his eyes. The dragon reared on its haunches 
	and let out an earsplitting roar but Sir David was unfazed. With a yell of his own, 
	he charged toward the dragon and the Knight in white armor. Prince Alex heard 
	another clash of metal against metal and watched as the mysterious Knight disarmed 
	Sir David and kicked him to the ground. </h4>
	<h4>The dragon roared again and the knight put the tip of the silvery sword to Sir 
	David&rsquo;s throat. And in one swift motion, the white helmet was removed, revealing a 
	cascade of shimmering blonde hair and stern hazel eyes. </h4>
	<h4><q>What. Do you think. You&rsquo;re doing?!?!</q></h4>
