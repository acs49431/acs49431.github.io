	<H2>The Princess</h2>
	</div>
	<H4>Prince Alex found himself so stunned, he could not form a reaction for several 
	seconds. The white knight glanced back and forth between himself and Sir David, who 
	seemed to be in an equal state of shock. </H4>
	
	<H4><q>Who&hellip;who are you,</q> Prince Alex asked when he finally gathered his bearings. High 
	above, the dragon snorted and shook its massive head. Its shining orange eyes watched 
	him intently. </H4>
	
	<H4><q>My name is Kaya. Who are you and why were you trying to kill my dragon?</q> </H4>
	
	<H4><q>Your dragon?</q> Sir David asked, finally pulling himself from the dirt. <q>M&rsquo;lady, I 
	think you are mistaken. This dragon&rsquo;s greed sent it to attack a nearby kingdom. He 
	kidnapped a princess!</q></H4>
	
	<H4>The knight let out a sharp laugh. </H4>
	
	<H4><q>Perhaps I should reintroduce myself. I am Princess Kaya from the land of Dayn. 
	And as for the greed of this dragon, SHE is nothing short of noble and would never 
	act on such petty human desires. Besides, I wasn&rsquo;t kidnapped. I ran away to join the
	riders.</q></H4>
	
	<H4><q>The Riders of the North Wind?</q></H4>
	
	<H4><q>The very same,</q> the princess said with a nod. The great dragon lowered her head\
	to stare at Sir David. Alex suddenly felt a surge of protectiveness, but it was soon
	buried under his incredulity. </H4>
	
	<H4><q>M&rsquo;lady, I still don&rsquo;t understand. If you went off to join the riders, why would
	your father have made up such a tale? Why would he have begged us this dragon if it
	was yours?</q> </H4>
	
	<H4>The princess sighed and sheathed her sword. </H4>
	
	<H4><q>My father wants Nikkia dead. He believes she will turn me against him and lead 
	to the downfall of his kingdom. He doesn&rsquo;t understand that it is he himself who has 
	turned me against him.</q> </H4>
	
	<H4>She stared into the distance. It wasn&rsquo;t until Alex cleared his throat that she 
	refocused on the Prince. </H4>
	
	<H4><q>Anyway, as you can see, there&rsquo;s no reason for you to do anything so you might 
	as well return home.</q> </H4>
	
	<H4><q>I quite agree, your majesty. Though perhaps you could do a quick favor for us 
	before you continue North&hellip;</q> Prince Alex said, his silvery words slipping off his 
	honey dressed tongue. </H4>
