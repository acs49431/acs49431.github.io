	<H2>The Knight</h2>
	</div>
	<body>
		<H4>Two days after the dragon attacked, a messenger came sprinting into the great hall of 
		the Castle, causing a great disturbance. Alex, his brothers, and many of the inhabiting 
		knights gathered to listen to the courier&rsquo;s message. The messenger spoke of a fierce and
		terrible dragon who had taken the princess of the small land of Dayn and presented
		a message from their king, begging the king of Solaria for help. </h4>
		
		<H4>Immediately realizing the threat of having a dragon on nearby lands, the King 
		of Solaria agreed to help and called forth his greatest knight, Sir David, to slay
		the dragon and bring back the princess safe and sound. Realizing this would perhaps
		be his only chance to own a kingdom of his own, Prince Alex rushed forward and 
		volunteered to accompany the knight on the journey. His father said no but with a 
		few persuasive words, Alex was soon allowed to undertake the task. </h4>
		
		<H4>He and Sir David set off in the direction of the white hills, where the dragon
		was rumored to have made its hunting grounds. The journey took several days and 
		nights and all the while, Sir David and Prince Alex talked constantly about their 
		lives. Alex told David about growing up as the youngest son of the King, spending 
		hours and hours reading around the castle, and learning how to talk his way out of
		precarious situations. David told Alex about his childhood as lower nobility, 
		about fighting with sticks in the woods to practice his swordsmanship, and about 
		the first beast he had ever slain. By the time the two had reached the base of the
		hills, they had become close friends. </h4>
		
		<H4>Leaving their horses behind, Sir David and Prince Alex began to ascend the 
		white hills. They traveled for hours until finally, with weary legs and drooping
		heads, the two settled into a small crevice on one of the hillsides. They lit 
		their fire, cooked their food, and settled in for the night. It wasn&rsquo;t until 
		he was looking out over the expanse of hills that Alex realized one was moving.</h4>
