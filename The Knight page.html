		<h4>Sir David Angoliath was the youngest knight to ever be delivered high honors. He recieved this honor not after singlehandedly defending a 
		village from an onslaught of raiders, nor after deafeating three giants while blind folded and armed only with a fork. No, the honors were
		hand delivered to him by the King of Solaria after he proved to be only knight who could open the pickle jar. He gets along (very) well with Prince
		Alex and I totally ship it.</h4>
